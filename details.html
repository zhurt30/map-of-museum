		<h2>Billings Estate National Historic Site</h2>
		<h3>About US</h3>
		<p><img src="img/BIllings.jpg"/ style="float:left;margin: 10px">The Billings family settled on the shores of the
			Rideau River in 1812 and took an active role in shaping the
			community as it evolved over time and until the 1970s when they left the estate. They helped build farms and
			churches, ran a dairy operation, and contributed to the development of the Byward Market by providing
			produce for
			sale and building the "Farmers' Bridge".</p>

		<h2>Goulbourn Museum</h2>
		<h3>About us</h3>
		<p><img src="img/Goulbourn.jpg"/ style="float:left;margin: 10px">Built in 1872, the
			building currently known as
			the Goulbourn Museum used to be the old Town Hall. Despite
			being the
			size of a one-room school house this popular community hub was home to council meetings, parties and dances.
			The
			adjacent History Centre building was built in 1961 and was the former Clerks building. Now it is used to
			store the
			artefact collection, as office space, and to hold meetings and research appointments.</p>
		<p>The Goulbourn Museum is home to interactive and hands-on exhibitions such as <em>The 100<sup>th</sup>
				Regiment of
				Foot </em>about the soldiers who settled Goulbourn Township in 1818 after the War of 1812-1814; <em>The
				Village
				Store</em> where kids can dress up as pioneers and shop or barter for supplies; as well as exhibits
			about early
			Goulbourn settlers, the communities in the Township, and local services. The Museum is located just south of
			Stittsville at Stanley’s Corners.</p>
		<h3>Admission to the Museum is by Donation</h3>
		<p>The History Centre is open by appointment. Please call <a href="tel:613-831-2393">613-831-2393</a> or email:
